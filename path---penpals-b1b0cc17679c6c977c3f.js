I\'ve been watching a lot of Stranger Things, if you can\'t already tell.</p>\n<p>This is the first Terminal Man song I\'ve hosted on YouTube instead of SoundCloud. Slightly annoying to have to make a movie out of the mp3 before uploading, but I do like my iMovie Star Wars crawl thing going on here. And I feel more confident that dropping stuff onto YouTube is like putting it into an Indiana Jones-style vault or time capsule that won\'t ever go away or shut down.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"24 July 2018",path:"/penpals",title:"Penpals",author:"Charles Harrington",category:"Music"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
