I put together this simple Gatsby.js static site with the raw text (and some YouTube links) of the speeches in my dataset. <a href="https://github.com/whatrocks/commencement-db">PRs are open for the dataset</a> if anyone\'s interested in contributing. Right now, the best we have is the NPR "Best of" commencement speech website, which hasn\'t been updated since 2015. It would be great to find a way to make a new home for great speeches on the web.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"23 July 2018",path:"/using-nlp-to-write-graduation-speeches",title:"Using NLP to Write Graduation Speeches",author:"Charles Harrington",category:"Deep Learning"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
