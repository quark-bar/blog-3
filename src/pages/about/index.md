Hi, I'm Charlie Harrington. I'm a software engineer at [Cruise](https://www.getcruise.com), writer and [podcaster](https://www.escapingweb.com) in San Francisco.

### Projects

[Von Chomp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/von-chomp/id1211087343?mt=8) is my weird and mostly-useless monster tally-counter iOS app. It's perfect for counting things. Yum.

[Escaping Web](https://www.escapingweb.com) is a show with my friend [Oz Nova](https://twitter.com/oznova_) about software engineers who've found their calling outside of routine web development. We talk a lot about learning and learning how to learn and learning how to learn how to learn. Also the history of computers.

I'm also in the midst of writing a novel about robots. More on that soon!

Here's me at the Grand Canyon after our R2R2R run, looking incredibly salt-deprived.
