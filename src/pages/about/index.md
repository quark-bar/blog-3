Hi, I'm Charlie Harrington. I'm a software engineer and writer in San Francisco.

I'm interested in the history of computing, education, storytelling, and how technology can bring magic to life. Find out more about my work on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlieharrington/).

If you're looking for a weird and semi-useless app, you can download my [free monster counting app on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/von-chomp/id1211087343?mt=8). I'm also working on a children's book about robots. More on that soon!

> It's a thousand pages, give or take a few. I'll be writing more in a week or two.

OK, more about me. *Go play outside* is my favorite punishment. In my spare time I enjoy running biking, and swimming, and sometimes all three in the same day. I've [escaped from Alcatraz](/alcatraz-challenge-2016-review). I'm an [ENFP](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality) and a Helper. I haunt used book stores. My favorite genre is fictional memoirs of real Roman emperors (e.g. I, Cladius, Memoirs of Hadrian).

Here's a picture of me at the Grand Canyon:
