Hi, I'm Charlie Harrington. I'm a software engineer, writer, and [podcaster](https://www.escapingweb.com) in San Francisco.

### Projects

[Von Chomp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/von-chomp/id1211087343?mt=8) is a weird and semi-useless monster tally-counter iOS app.

[Escaping Web](https://www.escapingweb) is bi-weekly show with [Oz Nova](https://twitter.com/oznova_) about engineers who've found their calling outside of routine web development.

I'm also working on a novel about robots. More on that soon!

### Outside

I like being outside. Here's me at the Grand Canyon:
