I'm currently reading a fantastic novel where the protaganist - who is in her teens and lives in a sort-of convent for sightseers in the middle of a glacier - is asked by the elders to choose a role for part-time work. Our hero considers two options:

* Become a pilot of paper-mache, semi-alive airplanes controlled by whistling
* Become a librarian

I held my breath as I read further: *choose The Library!*

### Why Libraries?

There are two things that, when I encounter them in a book, immediately cause me to fall in love.

* The word `palimpsest`
* A giant, possibly magic, library (extra points for a Forbidden Section or two)

The two are not unrelated. A [palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest) is a book that has been one or more books before, with the older knowledge hidden just beneath the surface of the parchment, waiting to be unearthed. A giant library must, invariably, contain books with once-known, now-forgotten knowledge, just beyond that locked door over there.

But I have the key...

I hereby present a list of the very best novels featuring giant libraries filled with secrets.
