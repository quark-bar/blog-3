I\'m hoping to talk with lots of real human beings who are doing fun, creative, interesting, and / or surprising things with machine learning and AI. Those things might be weekend projects, work projects, or school projects -- doesn\'t matter, just something that people are excited to talk about and share with the community. I\'m eager to learn from them and be inspired by their creativity, focus, and ideas. Another tangential goal of mine is to get better at interviewing people.</p>\n<p>So far, I\'ve chatted with <a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/humans-of-ml-leanne-luce/">Leanne Luce</a> about her experiments with AI and fashion blogging, and <a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/humans-of-ml-kalai-ramea/">Kalai Ramea</a> about computational creativity. A few more conversations are already in the pipeline. If you\'re doing something creative with machine learning, please reach out on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/whatrocks">@whatrocks</a>).</p>\n<p>You can also find the interviews at <a href="http://humansofml.com">humansofml.com</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"30 July 2018",path:"/humans-of-machine-learning",title:"Humans of Machine Learning",author:"Charles Harrington",category:"Deep Learning"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
